            <h2>Values</h2>
        <main>
            <p>Will power is the word that stood out to me the most in that collection of values.  Will power is important to me because it radiates positively through every other aspect of life.  I believe that anything can be accomplished if I put enough energy, focus and will into it, and acheiving that kind of effort is something that I work on improving every day.  I chose it in relationship to the happiest moments in my life because I am happiest when I am accomplishing any task that pushes the boundaries of my capabilities.  That's part of why I enjoy DBC so much, almost every challenge pushes me to be cleverer and more focused than I have been in a long time.<br>I struggle alot at self-motivating.  When I am on my own, I find it all to easy to sit around and waste time on espn, or playing destiny, or hanging out with friends.  I need structure in my life to stay focused and motivated, and it took me a long time to realize that.  DBC has already been very helpful in that regard, the weekly challenges have sparked some order back into my life that has been missing since college.  Overall I would give myself a 3 on the 1 - 5 scale.  I choose three because when I am motivated, I am one-hundred percent commited, but when that will power fades I can be incredibly lazy and disinterested.  My interest level wanes occasionally when a subject stops being new, and sustaining that initial interest and drive is something that I work on every day.  DBC has sustained my interest really well so far, and I believe that programming is dynamic and challenging in a way that will help me stay happy and focused on it for a long time.<br>Ont to advice.  The literal last time someone asked me for advice (chronologically) was about Fantasy Football.  I get a lot of those, my friends know that I take fantasy pretty seriously.  The last serious discussion I had with someone was about his parents.  My parents are going through a divorce, and his parents are having some troubles too and we just talked about realizing that your parents are flawed people too, and that sometimes you need to take care of them as well.  Family issues are always difficult, but I think we agreed in that talk that it's healthy to stop thinking of your parents as ideas and start thinking of them as people, as older versions of ourselves.  It's healthier in the long run, and it really opens your perspective on them.<br></p>
