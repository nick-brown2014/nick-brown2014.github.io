            <h2>Some Information on Methods and Objects in Ruby</h2>
        <main>
            <p>So the ruby method that I decided to look up is the Enumerable#cycly method.  This seems like a very useful method, and although I took the time (and am glad that I did) to look at all of the methods, #cycle is the one that I can see myself using the most frequently.<br>So enumerable methods are loop statements that ruby has short-cutted into the code, to put things plainly.  This prevents us from living like Javascript people who have to write all of their methods out, over and over again.  How sad for them.  In ruby, we have methods that loop already written and ready to use, and #cycle is one of those lovely methods.<br>Now on to what it actually does.  It is a method that is meant to be called on an array, and simply put it will perform a block of code on each value in that array as many times as you ask it to.  It is basically a shortcut for writing a #times method combined with an #each method.  Quite handy, as I have written methods using that unwieldy combination before.  You can tell the code to do anything to these variables, from simply stating them to performing math or whatever else you like code to do.  The point is, it is a quicker and cleaner way to do fun loops of code, and for that, Ruby, we thank you.<br></p>
