            <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
        <main>
            <p>So this post is going to be on the difference between object oriented programming and procedural programming.  The best place to start with this description should be with procedural programming, because it is the easiest to understand<br>Procedural programming is basically programming to accomplish a task, point a to point b simple as that.  It's like you need a loop, you write the loop, and there the code works you call it a day go home and drink some iced tea.  And it totally works, which is great but not as great as...<br>Object Oriented programming!  Imagine that code that you wrote, and how long it took you to make.  Let's say it was a complicated loop, and you aren't the best programmer, so it took you an hour.  That means that with the rest of your day, you had one less hour to spend drinking iced tea.  Which is a shame, because you love iced tea.  Object Oriented Programming is a shortcut so that you can drink that iced tea faster.<br>Now I don't want to be misunderstood here, Object Oriented Programming (OOP) does not allow you to write the same code faster.  That loop that took you an hour to write before will still take you an hour to write in OOP.  The difference, and what is really cook about OOP is that you can use that code that took you an hour and re-use it over and over on all kinds of fun objects and in classes until it makes you sick.  Which means that over the course of your programming life, you will have much more time in the long run to drink iced tea.<br>More pracitcally, imagine a very large program, and then imagine that you are for whatever reason writing this very large program.  This program is going to work on a lot of similar data structures, and need to re-use functions many times.  Now, you can use Procedural Programming, and write code until you are an old, sad man while your friends all die off away from you because you were coding all the time.  That's an option that you have.  OR, and I recommend this highly, you can use OOP to create classes and modules and re-use lots of your code over and over and save tons of time and drink iced tea with your friends all day long and laugh at Gary who is still doing his Procedural Programming in the corner.  Silly Gary.<br>So that is the long and the short of why you should use OOP.  To save tons of time, write tighter, cooler looking code that you can impress your friends with, and not be like Gary.  Don't be like Gary, use OOP.<br></p>
