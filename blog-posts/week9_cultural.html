            <h2>Asking Questions About Code</h2>
        <main>
            <p>The first time I had to ask someone a question about code was during my application process into programming boot camps.  I am particularly fortunate to have access to my brother as a resource (he has a CS masters) and I wanted the answer to a Javascript problem.  It was a simple problem, I had forgotten the 'return' statement and my code was coming up empty because of it.  I asked my brother for the answer, and he said no.  Then he spent the next thrity minutes walking my paitently through my code until I saw that I was missign the 'return' statement, fixed my code and solved the challenge.<br>At first I was mad at him, he knew what the answer was and could have saved us both a not inconsiderable amount of time.  But I realized that he had taught me a lesson about coding that was much more valuable than the answer to a simple Javascript challenge.  He explained that coding is a frustrating line of work to get into, but that taking the easy answer instead of following through until you understand the answer was never the way to go.  It is better to sweat over the code for an hour until you really understand your problem than to have somebody else copy/paste the answer in for you, because in the latter situation you don't learn anything.<br>I am lucky (again) to be in a program where I will have access to brilliant, helpful people all the time, people who know a lot about code and could almost certainly write all of the code I need to get through my challenges.  What I want from these people isn't the answer to coding problems, it's advice in how to best find the answer.  What I got from my brother in that half hour was a better understanding of my code and how to troubleshoot it, and that is well worth the time it took, and that is exactly the kind of help that I would ask for at DBC.<br></p>
