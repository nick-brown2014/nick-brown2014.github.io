            <h2>Pairing</h2>
        <main>
            <p>Pairing with others is always a bit of a nerve-racking experience.  At least the build up to the pairing session is, especially.  Almost all of the pairing sessions that I have been in have ended u being really enjoyable and educational experiences.  Not only is it great to see somebode else's code and to learn technically from them, but it is also very helpful to have to explain yourself and your line of thought out loud.  It can be incredibly difficult, to bridge what you are thinking to what you are saying but the process of clarifying those thoughts has been super helpful to me.  I had one frustrating pairing session where I didn't feel that I was really able to express myself and get my ideas across to my partner, but aside from that one they have all been really helpful, and the people that I have met in the sessions have been extremely nice.<br>Reading my feedback was wonderful, I was really happy to see that a lot of people had really nice things to say about me.  It isn't super constructive, I think that just from reading hte feedback that I have gotten and the feedback that I have rated people are more concerned with being kind than actionable.  This is admirable in one sense, the sense that it is important to bouy the confidence and spirits of your fellow classmates, but I wish there were more people trying to really help each other learn in their comments.  It is a trap that I have felt myslef falling into at times as well.<br>Pairing is in my opinion one of the most imporant parts of this prep experience, and I am excited to do more of it.<br></p>
