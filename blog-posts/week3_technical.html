            <h2>When to Use Javascript</h2>
        <main>
            <p>
                So the sites that I researched all had sort of the same thing to say about Javascript.  The agreed upon thesis was this: that Javascript and its usage can be determined by its one defining characteristic.<br>This characteristic is that Javascript is an incredibly dynamic language, capable of performing many different tasks.  It can be used to style a website instead of CSS, create interactive content or validate forms.  However, it should only be used when another language will not suffice.<br>To wit, CSS will do a better and easier to understand job of styling a website, and their are better ways to validate forms in HTML as well.  Javascript is excellent for accomplishing tasks that cannot be done in any other language, and therein lies the usefullness of the language.  It is so open-ended that it can accomplish what other languages cannot.  That being said, the open-endedness causes the language to be a bit unwieldy and difficult to use, which is why when another language can do the trick, it should be allowed to.  Javascript is like the last resort tool in the Developer's toolkit.  When nothing else can do th job, Javascript can find a way.
