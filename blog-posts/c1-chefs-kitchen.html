            <p>That video actually made me feel a lot better about getting to DevBootCamp.  That last couple of days have been a little stressful for me. Trying to finish Week One in one and a half days on little sleep has been rough on me, but the fear that I have been feeling is exactly what Shereef talked about in the video.  I am worried that tomorrow someone is going to look at my half-baked blog and say, this person doesn't belong here, it looks like he barely knows CSS at all.  Which is true, because I do.  But I am learning it, and I am honestly excited to keep learning it, and to get that comfortable feeling that comes from understanding the basics well enough to innovate with them and make something really fun.  Learning something new always comes with anxieties, this happens to be a program where I feel like there a ton of expectations on me already and that can be scary.  But it's a long process and we are just beginning it together, and it is going to be fun.</p>
