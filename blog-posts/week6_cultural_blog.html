            <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
        <main>
            <p>I'll start this bog post by discussing exactly what stereotype threat is.  Stereotype threat is when an individual performs below their capabilities based on thier expectations or fears of fulfilling pre-existing sterotypes.  This means that because a person has been told that their race or ethnicity is worse at something, they are predisposed to act subconciously in a way that complies to that expectation.  It has been verified in some scientific studies, and is a difficult and emotional issue for many.<br>I have not really experienced much stereotype threat in my life.  I was born Jewish, and even though I don't consider myslef religious in any fashion I still call myself a Jew.  Judaism for me is a cultural identity, a lifestyle and a set of values that were instilled in me as a child and have absolutely nothing to do with any kind of faith or theology.  What that rambling statement boils down to is that I consider myself a Jew by my own terms, and have always identified as such.<br>Now I was raised in a nice neighborhood, in schools and camps that had lots of other Jewish children, so I never really felt like much of an outsider.  I would hear comments now in then, meant to be innocuous.  Things like, "You don't look Jewish", or, "Wait, so you don't eat bacon, right?".  These never really got to me, none of them have ever been malicious, and nobody has ever tried to insult me with my heritage.  Past the occasional joke when I grab a quarter off the floor, being Jewish doesn't really have much of an effect on my daily life.  For the most part, I encourage people to joke about my heritage, and to be comfortable pointing out when I or other Jews among our friends are affirming stereotyeps.  I think that by laughing and openly discussing stereotypes, we take the power away from them.  I understand however that this is partly a privelege born from being in a society where my race isn't truly considered a threat or disadvantage.  It isn't this way for Jews around the world, and it certainly isn't this way for most other minorities.  Openness and direct honesty are a large part of my beliefs in any aspect of my life, and I see no reason why stereotype threat should be treated any differently.  If people are open and honest about what they are comfortable (and uncomfortable) with, then I think they are more likely to get the treatment that they prefer.<br>Addressing the mechanisms of social change on a large scale is a dubious proposition any time, but I do truly believe in small personal changes.  There is a Jewish saying from Rabbi Hillel that goes, "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you."  This is the way that I try to impact people's views around me, by acting the way that I would like to see others act and by being open with them and with myself.<br></p>
