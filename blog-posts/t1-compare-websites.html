            <h2>My Three Most Visited Websites:</h2>
        <main>
            <p>My favorite Websites:<br><br><a href="espn.go.com">ESPN</a>, because I am a sports fan of course, but also because it is a well designed and easy to navigate site.  All of the sports that you want are at the top, so you can choose which one you want to look at first.  There is also a list of top trending stories that is good for someone like me who doesn't care for every sport, (golf, nascar) but still wants to know the major news in everything.<br><br><a href="facebook">Facebook</a>. I know, it's a vice and I wish I didn't spend so much time there but I really do like it a lot for catching up with people that I cannot see every day, especially since I just graduated college and so many of my friends are spread out across the country.  It also keeps me entertained for longer than I care to admit with buzzfeed links and rants from my more politically minded friends.<br><br><a href="dotafire.com">DotaFire</a> is my nerdy obsession.  It is a website that has information and guides for beginners to Dota 2, and while I was just starting out playing I looked on it almost every day.  It has guides for every hero, descriptions of items and links to other resources to learn gaming techniques.  It is organized well, so that you can search by hero name, type and popularity. <br></p>
