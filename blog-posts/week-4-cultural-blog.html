            <h2>Problems in the Tech World</h2>
        <main>
            <p>So after some research online it would appear that there is an overwhelming consensus that the most pressing issue facing the tech industry today is a lack of representative diversity.  Women hold a proportionally small percentage of tech jobs (about 25 %) and are unusually likely to quit those jobs.  The first site that I looked at had a truly bizarre story about an app called Titstare (if you know why someone would need an app for that, let me know) that led to some firings, and some quittings, and then eventually some progress in recognizing the apparent mysoginies that are rampant in the tech industry.  The nest story I read was about people making a 'dongle' joke, and a tweet about that joke that led to, again, a lot of firings and twitter rage that should never have been necessary.<br>So the tech industry clearly has a problem with diversity, specifically gender diversity.  There does not seem to be much argument against that fact.  The progress towards solving this problem seems to be slow, but removing bias from a group is generally a ponderous and painful procedure.  Change in these areas is not like a surgery, where there is a single problematic bit that can be removed and discarded.  It is a violent antibiotic that must be administered to every part of the body, even (maybe especially) those who do not think they need it.  I do not know what I can do personally to help women in the industry, I am very new to the problem and do not fully grasp the reality of the situation, and frankly I have never been much of an acitivist.  I try to live and act in a way that I would like to see others do, and speak up when I see something wrong.  I am certain that in time more can be done, and the nature of that change will reveal itself.<br></p>
