            <h2>SQL Injection</h2>
        <main>
            <p>So what exactly is SQL Injection?  It is the intentional or unintentional insertion of harmful or incorrect data into SQL tables.  Simply put, it is putting bad data into tables.  This can happen accidentally, but the term Injection is more commonly used to refer to the intentional use of misinformation by hackers to either disrupt, delete or steal data.<br>So what can young Johnny Programmer do to combat this evil?  Well there are a couple of options that I found, including Escaping, Pattern Checking and using Database Permissions.<br>Escaping is simple enough.  Basicaaly you tell SQL to Escape (or remove) any characters that have special meaning in SQL.  So words that would DROP or SELECT data don't have their usual effect.<br>Pattern Checking is a little more comprehensive of a solution, basically incoming strings will be checked to see if they match certain acceptable or problematic patterns.  This allows for a wider range of possibilities in prevention.<br>Finally, Database Permissions are used to deny access to individuals using SQL statements.  This can also help prevent hackers from expoliting bugs to steal or corrupt data.<br>From what I read, SQL Injection is a serious problem, and even though XKCD makes light of it I am sure that many people take it much more seriously.  Programming is frought with people who look to steal, cheat or otherwise destroy the work of others.  Mybrother works in programming securities, so I know a little about it.  So long as the people working to stop the hackers are smarter than the hackers themselves, most of us have nothing to worry about. That being said, it is always a good reminder when you think about how fragile the data that you share iwth the internet is, and how careful you need to be with yoru private information.<br></p>
