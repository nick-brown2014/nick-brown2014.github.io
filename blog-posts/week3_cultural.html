            <h2>My Thinking Style</h2>

            <p>
                My journey through the DBC prep-work up to this point has not been the most fluid of journeys.  I started the firt week late, barely finished the next day, and have not managed to turn in a single one of my weeks in on time.  Strangely, I feel completely confident in my abilities as an aspiring programmer despite these mistakes.  I am no totally confident in my ability to code in HTML and CSS, and have actually started to enjoy the puzzle-like atmosphere that walks hand-in-hand with coding.  Javascript I still feel like I am just beginning to learn, but the open-ended nature of the language is intriguing to me.<br>
                When I look at my results from the Gregorc Thinking Style quiz after these first three weeks, I can see reflected in those characteristics the reason for some of my struggles and successes.  I was defined as both a Concrete Random thinker, and an Abstract Random thinker, emphasis on the Abstract.  Neither of these definitions surprised me, I have alwaya thrived in person-to-person environments where I can talk to somebody in the flesh, and have also always liked to learn through experimentation.  Learning through experimentation lends itself really well to CSS, where it is easier to try a bunch of things and learn from your mistakes than conceptually visualize all the display and positioning properties in your head.<br>That being said, the fact that I enjoy face-to-face conversation much more than internet interactions has caused me a lot of trouble so far in this course.  I don't like reaching out for help over the internet, which makes me a little more shy about contacting my cohort and others when I have problems with my code, and even reaching out to my advisor.  It has also held me back in pairing, because I have been shy about asking or accepting pairing requests from my cohort-mates.<br>I've decided that I can't let that get in the way of my learning any longer, and I have made a pact with myself to be more proactive earlier in the week about pairing with others and commiting to those appointments.  I need to take my face-to-face skills and translate them into screen-to-screen skills if I want to succeed in this program, and I do want that very much.  Part of having a growth mindset is accepting where you have fallen down and looking into that area for improvement.  In this next month I will be more proactive in getting pairing, and better at getting my voice heard in those sessions, and I won't accept the Monday after the deadline to finalize my work.  I've got a lot of coding left to do, and the time to start making little good habits is now.  Here we go unit two!
